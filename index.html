            <h1>My First Pygame</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my first Pygame project! This is an incredibly simple game where you can move a box around a screen.<br>
                Unfortunately, the game does not have any specific objective or goal, but it serves as a great starting point for learning Pygame and Python programming.<br>
                The game is designed to be easy to understand and modify, making it perfect for beginners who want to learn the basics of game development.<br>
                You can move the box using the WASD keys on your keyboard, and you can also change the color of the box by pressing the 'C' key.<br>
                Feel free to explore the code and make your own modifications to create a more complex game or add new features.<br>
                I hope you enjoy playing and learning with this simple Pygame project!<br></p>
            
            <h2>How to Download and Run the Game</h2>
            <p>To play the game, follow these steps:<br>
                    1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your computer.<br>
                    2. Open the downloaded file in Terminal (or the equivalent for your Operating System) and copy the entire code.<br>
                    3. Open a code editor, such as Visual Studio Code, and make a new Python file, 'main.py'.<br>
                    4. Paste the copied code, and run the code by pressing the 'Run' button and then the 'Run Without Debugging' button.<br>
                    5. The game window will open, and you will see a box on the screen.<br>
                    6. Use the WASD keys to move the box around the screen.<br>
                    7. Press the 'C' key to change the color of the box.<br>
                    8. Have fun exploring and modifying the code to create your own unique game experience!<br></p>

                Note: If you are using a browser that does not support downloading files directly, you can right-click the link and select "Save Link As..." to download the file. <br>
                If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always looking for ways to improve and learn more about Pygame and Python programming.<br>
                Enjoy the game!</p>
