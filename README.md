# First-Attempt-Game
Third Project created for Athena Project (First Attempt at a Game)

This is a very simple website with a link and instructions on how to play my first Pygame.

The website contains mostly text, with a button linked to my code, created using HTML. With most of the website, including text and background, being coloured light or dark green, using CSS, for the fun of it. The game itself does require some work to play, and is honestly not worth the effort. Running the code, after following the instructions on the website, allows you to move a white square around a black screen using WASD keys. Pressing specified buttons will momentarily change the colour of the square and/or invert the colours of the entire window.

This really isn't anything special, I just wanted the time I spent on this game to be worth it. (As well as the unmentionable amount of time it took me to be able to download Pygames on this God-forsaken computer.)
I'm going to continue to work using Pygame in the hopes that this will be the most basic project I've made using Pygames.
